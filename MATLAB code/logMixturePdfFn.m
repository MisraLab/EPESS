function [ density ] = log_mixture_pdf_fn(x, number_mixtures, mixture_weights, mixture_means, mixture_chol )
%Stably calculates log pdf of the simulated mixture.
%   Naively calculating the log pdf will lead to NaNs. The problem stems
%   from moving between log and exp. This code does all of the calculations
%   in the log space. Specifically:
%   log( sum (normal_i) ) = log(max(normal_i)) + log ( sum ( exp( log(normal_i) - log(max(normal_i))  ) ) )

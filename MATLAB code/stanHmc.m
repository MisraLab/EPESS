%% For a mixture of gaussians, this code samples from HMC using Stan.

% We input the mixture parameters and pass it as data to Stan.
% The Stan file is coded for a mixture of gaussians posterior density.
% mixture - covariance matrix has been reshaped -- to be able to parse in
% as input to Stan. We recove covariance matrices for each component in
% Stan code.

        
%% Creating data for Stan

%% Creating data for Stan 2
% We want to create an array of matrices and pass it in Stan

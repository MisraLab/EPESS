%   Code for sampling a truncated multi-variate normal using EPESS
  
%   Steps:
  
% 0. Set hyperparameters
%
% 1. Simulate a mvg, specify the constraints -- randomly for now
%
% 2. Get the  EP-approximation -- John's code
%
% 3. Perform ESS given the EP approximation
%
% 4. Plot distributions (if 2 dimensional)
%
% 5. Calculate the Effective Sample Size
%
% 6. HMC Comparison -- Ari's Code
%
% 7. HMC vs EPESS

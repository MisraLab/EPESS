% This code implements the simulated mixture of Gaussians for testing
% EPESS. The code has the following sections:
%
% 0. Set hyperparameters
%
% 1. Simulate the mixture of Gaussians
%
% 2. Calculate the EP-approximation (for any alpha)
%
% 3. Perform ESS given the EP approximation
%
% 4. Plot distributions (if 2 dimensional)
%
% 5. Calculate convergence Diagnostics and Effective Sample Size
%
% 6. HMC Comparison
%
% 7. Plotting HMC vs reults for a given alpha

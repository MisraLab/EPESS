% Probit Regression for Breast Cancer Data

%   Steps:

% 0. Set hyperparameters
%
% 1. Get real data - UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29)
%    This is the one used in GESS paper
%
% 2. Get the EP approximation ?? Not done yet
%
% 3. Perform ESS given the EP approximation  ??  Not done yet
%
% 4. Comaprison with HMC using Stan, ESS, Recycled ESS and EP-MH
%
% 5. Comparisons with other algorithms - GESS

% Need to verify with Emperical KL - how well exact HMC explores the space,
% specially in higher dimensions.

% Have to resolve issues when the Wall hitting returns angle_slice as 0

% Observations:
% In terms of n_eff/fn_evalaution, EPESS is able to outperform Exact HMC very fast -- x=5 is sufficient
% Better performance if we elongate the slice along y-axis and also make the variance large along y in the original gaussian 
% Intuitive -- now Exact-HMC needs to traverse a larger vertical distance
% -- tuning in terms of T will need to be done. Also the fact that exact
% HMC finds it much harder t climb vertically.

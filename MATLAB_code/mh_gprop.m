% INPUTS:
% mu: EP-proposed mean, a column vector of length D. We will use this as the initial point. 

% sigma: EP-proposed covariance, a PSD and symmetric matrix, D-by-D
% target: log-probability density at any given point - for the target
% distribution we want to sample from
% nsamples: number of samples demanded, also as termination condition

% OUTPUTS:
% samples: nsamples-by-D matrix, all accepted samples
% acc_ratio: percentage of samples accepted
